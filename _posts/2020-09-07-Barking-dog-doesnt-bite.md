## Why SARS-CoV-2 may be more simple and deadly than we previously thought"

A paper initially published at
[July 7th](https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://elifesciences.org/articles/59177)
(as of 2020) reads *"A mechanistic model and therapeutic interventions for
COVID-19 involving a RAS-mediated bradykinin storm"* with the only relevant
content published alongside being a
[very short abstract](https://web.archive.org/web/20200709051108/https://elifesciences.org/articles/59177).

Later on, most of their relevant findings were published on the paper's [official portal](https://elifesciences.org/articles/59177) editing the brief abstract and replacing it with research findings able to explain key characteristics from SARS-CoV-2, keys features which remained attributed to randomness by most scientists due to how they linked by mechanisms that could not be traced back to a single factor.

Using pharmacology and genetics to explain how SARS-CoV-2 works is nothing new, and many respectable papers have tried diverse approaches to this theme, the most notables being:

 Albeit these studies are relevant to the matter and discussing pharmacology and SARS-CoV-2 pharmacokinetics properties is one of the best approaches to unknown pathologies, they are biased towards explaining observable mechanisms and fail to identify underlying conditions that could be attributed to a single common underlying cause, seemingly only being able to explain what has been previously seen or studied, as a result their theories are limited on a theoretical framework.

 Instead of focusing on what they got 'wrong' individually, repeating in an analogous way the bias embedded in their respective perspectives into this novelty pathogen, this article will try to share a different perspective and why the cited properties are not only relevant, but they will be a huge part bioinformatics studies, especially when studying novelty pathogens.

## A brief historical academic review

Initially understood as a virus weaponized to affect our lungs, authorities quickly noticed something was amiss, shortly afterward a main binding mechanism was identified: angiotensin-2, or ACE-2 receptors, an unusual group with no known mechanism linked to cytokine storms nor respiratory diseases, coupled with these findings came the first wave of hospitalized patients and efforts in identifying the disease characteristics, where doctors noticed this virus
had serious symptoms such as cytokines storms and deadly pneumonia with severe affected lungs as a result, where patients regularly needed artificial breathing (i.e. ventilators) in order to stay alive. 

'Cytokine storm' is a loose term for classifying scenarios where your immunity system cells is unable to properly identify the foreign entity - such as a virus - and as a result it starts attacking its own tissues, 
a behavior that initially classified immune-depressed population and chronic respiratory diseases as higher "deadly risk" for currently infected SARS-CoV-2 patients. 
A conclusion that does not fit meta-analysis from historical data, as smokers were considered to be one of the most at-risk groups from initial analysis, instead, [they turned out 
to have a lower hospitalization ratio than your average non-smoker, surprisingly](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2040622320935765), a conclusion supported by data even when considering gender, age distribution, underlying 
 conditions and race.

Instead, scientists started to notice most worrying stealthy characteristics of the virus were actually aimed
at our cardiovascular system, [as the Troponin I biomarker could be used to monitor how severe the infection was on hospitalized
patients](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41569-020-0360-5?fbclid=IwAR3TjvxiEtYQqNkpsPuEuuef94Gp2m4a89YFxubY2pw2FtOxsSpxGZ18TmI), a protein
measured to infer how much damage is being generated to our heart tissues, that's why it is commonly used as a signaler for medics to forecast and alert *heart attacks*.
So anyone with chronic heart diseases was included in the risk group ahead of existing respiratory conditions, as cardiovascular comorbidities [started to surge as a comorbity able to predict
a patient outcome in terms of likelihood of survival](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpheart.00215.2020).

Another risk factor that increasingly got attention from the medical community were the kidneys, as one of the body's
organs most rich in ACE-2 receptors number counts, it seemed like an intuitive analysis: [kidneys are main targets for the virus](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/04/10/2020.03.04.20031120.full.pdf) and a [major risk factor](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2011400).
 This is one of the key characteristics that really surprised me on how backward the initial analysis were if you would consider a 'bradykinin storm' scenario.

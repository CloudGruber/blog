# Reverse-engineering genetics and 'bradykinin storm' as a theory

Initially published in [July 7th](https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://elifesciences.org/articles/59177) (as of 2020),  the paper title reads *"A mechanistic model and therapeutic interventions for COVID-19 involving a RAS-mediated bradykinin storm"* with the only relevant content published alongside being a [very short abstract](https://web.archive.org/web/20200709051108/https://elifesciences.org/articles/59177). 

Later on, most of their relevant findings were published on the paper's [official portal](https://elifesciences.org/articles/59177) editing the brief abstract and replacing it with research findings able to explain key characteristics from SARS-CoV-2, keys features which remained attributed to randomness by most scientists due to how they linked by mechanisms that could not be traced back to a single factor.

Using pharmacology and genetics to explain how SARS-CoV-2 works is nothing new, and many respectable papers have tried diverse approaches to this theme, the most notables being:

What they all have in common is the exact same characteristic that makes the 'bradykinin' theory so compelling: their findings can be attributed to the nature of the virus but rather explaining its main mechanism, they focus on the effects produced by the virus when inside the human body and we could circumvent it, failing to identify what these symptoms have in common. 

Instead of focusing on what they got wrong individually, I think it would be better to feature the properties responsible for leading to a different approach on the theme, why this should be relevant to the whole field of bioinformatics, especially further on when digging deeper on this exact same subject.
